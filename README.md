# Building a Coin Toss Game with Qt in C++ ðŸŽ®
## Introduction
During my first year studying Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), I built a simple Coin Toss Game using C++ and Qt. This project was an introduction for me to GUI development and randomization in games. Although simple, it strengthened my understanding of OOP concepts, UI design, and event-driven programming.
## How the Game Works ??
The game is based on a random coin toss mechanic where each toss gives the player a value of 50DA, 20DA, or 10DA. The goal is to reach exactly 100DA. If the total exceeds 100DA, the player loses.
### Key Features
* âœ… Randomized Coin Toss â€“ Generates a random value from {50DA, 20DA, 10DA}.
* âœ… Qt-Based GUI â€“ Interactive buttons, labels, and game messages.
* âœ… Win/Loss Condition â€“ Players must strategize to hit 100DA exactly.
### Challenges & Learnings
* Randomization in C++ â€“ Used QRandomGenerator to simulate randomness.
* Event Handling in Qt â€“ Implemented signals & slots to update UI dynamically.
* OOP Principles â€“ Created a structured design with encapsulated game logic.
## Conclusion
This project was a great introduction to GUI development in C++. It helped me understand Qtâ€™s event system, UI components, and randomization. While simple, it laid the foundation for more complex applications.
